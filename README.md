# Giftastic
This repository was created for UNCC's Coding Bootcamp homework assignment #6 - Giftastic.

## About
This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 
The GIPHY API is called using AJAX with JavaScript and jQuery used to change the HTML of the site. 
Click [here](https://buchananc.github.io/Giftastic/) to play!

## Instructions
When the user types in a topic (in this case an animal) and presses enter or clicks the "submit" button, a new "animal" button will be created in the HTML.

When the user clicks on an animal button, the page will grab 15 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Above every gif, a rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).

## Bonus Goals
This app is fully mobile responsive.

Additional gifs can be added to the page.

Each request should ADD 15 gifs to the page, and NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
